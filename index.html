                    <p>The <span class="keyword-highlight">pig butchering scam</span> is a sophisticated form of investment fraud where perpetrators build a relationship with the victim over time, often through social media or dating apps, before persuading them to invest in fake cryptocurrency ventures.</p>

                    <p>Romance scammers typically approach victims through dating apps, social media, or email with attractive profiles and compelling stories.

                    <p>Recovery depends on several factors including how the money was sent and how quickly you act. Contact your bank or credit card company immediately if you used those methods.

Consider consulting with a lawyer specializing in fraud recovery. Some victims have recovered funds through legal action or when authorities freeze scammer accounts.</p>
